### Educational Project
# Biology And Chemistry Craft

A website will be developed using HTML for the structure, CSS for the layout and JavaScript for the functionality, inspired by the Infinite Craft website(neal.fun/infinite-craft). This site will have as its main mechanic the possibility of dragging interactive elements, allowing users to experiment and understand concepts related to chemical reactions and biological materials.
